# Chip-8

This project is a Chip-8 emulator developed as part of my personal learning journey in emulation development. I followed a detailed tutorial from FreeCodeCamp that explained the logic and implementation of the Chip-8 emulator, which allowed me to gain valuable insights into how emulators work. While the tutorial provided a line-by-line explanation, I actively learned and understood the concepts behind the code, which significantly contributed to my understanding of emulation development. My own explanations of the code are commented throughout. 

# What is Chip-8?
Chip-8 is a simple, interpreted programming language used in the late 1970s and early 1980s to design video games for various microcomputers. The Chip-8 system interprets data from a ROM file and emulates games on modern platforms.

# How to Run the Emulator
1. Clone the Repository
   -  Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command: git clone https://github.com/AnvitaGanugapati/chip-8.git

2. Run the Emulator
   - Start a web server by running python3 -m http.server
   - Open the html file in a web browser

3. Load ROMs
   - To run a specific Chip-8 game, you'll need the corresponding ROM file. Place the ROM files in the appropriate directory and load them using the emulator's interface. I've included ROMS "BLINKY" and "BLITZ"
